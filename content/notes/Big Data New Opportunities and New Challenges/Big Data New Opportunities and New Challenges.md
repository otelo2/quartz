# Big Data: New Opportunities and New Challenges
This text by PhD Katina Michael from the University of Wollongong and PhD Keith W. Miller from the University of Missouri-St. Louis showcases some of the possible benefits that Big Data could have for society, but also the challenges that are associated with the widespread adoption of Big Data.

## Purpose, key ideas and conclusions
This section outlines what is the **objective or purpose of the text**, what were the **key ideas** identified and the **conclusions** provided.

### Purpose / Objective
The objective of this text is to shed some light to what are the applications of big data that can help society in some way, and at the same time explain what challenges the benefits have.

### Key ideas
#### Opportunities
* Big data has become possible thanks to many devices that now produce data.
* It can help discover hidden behavioral patterns of people.
* In science it can help discover the causes for diseases or aid in new discoveries.

#### Challenges
* Hard to figure out the balance between hoarding data and the cost of doing so.
* Pretty big ethical and privacy concerns
* Possibility for unintended and unpredictable results

### Conclusions
Big Data is here to stay, and while it hasn't been adopted to the point where the challenges of it are a deal-breaker, we are getting closer to that day. It is a technology with a lot of potential, and there is still time to address all the problems, but we simply can't ignore them.

## Since this reading is a survey or position...
For different types of text, different analysis must be performed. In this case, the text is a **survey or position**, thus we are going to **identify the problem or topic** that is analyzed, the **analysis criteria**, **methodology** to analyze, **interpretation** of the analysis and finally the **conclusions**.

### Problem / Topic
The topic for this text, as the title suggests, is the opportunities and challenges of Big Data, and how it can affect society in general and us as individuals.

### Analysis criteria
I identified that the criteria that seemed to be followed for the opportunities was to look at the current state of Big Data and what is being done with it, use the apparent tendency of where the technology is going, and make an informed guess about what could come in the future thanks to Big Data. 

For the challenges, the authors probably had concerns of their own or from colleagues in the area, like how to maintain individual privacy when every device generates data, or how challenging it is to store all the data while being cost effective. 

### Methodology
The methodology used is to first show where Big Data can be used and the good it can do, and then show what are the considerations that must be made regarding Big Data. It is important to note that the challenges are stated not as an imminent problem, but as a uncertainty that will have to be tackled down the line.

### Interpretation
The authors don't use the fact that there are challenges as an excuse to say that Big Data is bad and shouldn't be used. I believe that they just want to show the problems with it so that they can be started to work on.

### Conclusions
I believe that the authors themselves make the best conclusion: 

> We can live with many of these uncertainties for now with the hope that the benefits of big data will outweigh the harms, but we shouldn't blind ourserlves to the possible irreversibility of changes — whether good or bad — to society.

In other words, they are aware of the many benefits that Big Data may bring, in many different aspects of our lives, but these changes may not all be for the better.
