# What Next: A Half-Dozen Data Management Research Goals for Big Data and the Cloud
This short paper explains six of the most important but not often discussed challenges and possible research opportunities that have risen thanks to the increasing adoption of Big Data and Cloud based services.

## Purpose, key ideas and conclusions
This section outlines what is the **objective or purpose of the text**, what were the **key ideas** identified and the **conclusions** provided.

### Purpose / Objective
The purpose of the paper is to highlight six challenges in the Big Data and Cloud sector, describe why the problem exists, and in some of the challenges the author also outlines some first steps that can be taken to tackle the problem.

### Key ideas
I believe the best way to show the key ideas is to add each of the six challenges as described by the author.
1. Data privacy: Redefine the abstractions for access control and auditing for data platforms
2. Approximate results: Devise a querying technique for approximate results that is an order of magnitude faster compared to traditional query execution
3. Data exploration to enable deep analytics: Build an environment to enable data exploration for deep analytics
4. Enterprise data enrichment with web and social media: Identify services that given a list of entities and their properties, returns enrichment of entities based on information in web and social media with sufficiently high precision and recall
5. Query optimization: Rethink query optimization for data parallel platforms
6. Performance isolation for multi-tenancy: Define a model of performance SLAs for multi-tenant data systems that can be metered at low overhead. Develop resource allocation techniques to support multi-tenancy

### Conclusions
The disruption that has been Big Data and the Cloud have lead to many new opportunities and challenges, and it is our role as engineers to develop the infrastructure and tools to help enterprises achieve significant insight from their data collection.

## Since this reading is a survey or position...
For different types of text, different analysis must be performed. In this case, the text is a **survey or position**, thus we are going to **identify the problem or topic** that is analyzed, the **analysis criteria**, **methodology** to analyze, **interpretation** of the analysis and finally the **conclusions**.

### Problem / Topic
Some of the challenges that need attention now that Big Data and Cloud are becoming more mainstream.

### Analysis criteria
The author chooses problems that maybe aren't exclusive to the two big topics, but affect them and are areas of opportunity for research. They also avoid pointing out the challenges that have seen more coverage, so as to highlight the ones that are also important but less known to people outside the community.

### Methodology
The author either asked for or got insights about many of the problems via colleagues in the Data Management, Exploration, and Mining Group at Microsoft Research. 

### Interpretation
Author compares what the research problems are against the problems that enterprise faces, that way the problems that are more important to the companies are the ones being addressed.

### Conclusions
The author found six major areas that could be worked on: Data privacy, approximate results, data exploration to enable deep analytics, enterprise data enrichment with web and social media, query optimization, and performance isolation for multi-tenancy.

## Key references 
Throughout the text there were some references that we identified to be key for the understanding of the topic. These references are as follows:

	* Initial effort to study the model around Differential Privacy

	* Explains the difficulty of cardinality estimation for query sub-expressions, which is an integral part of query optimization
